C++ small game: how-much-do-you-want 

strategy game: how-much-do-you-want.

1. An Offeror and a Responder play a game
2. At a game, the Offerer is given by $100, and offers a portion of the money to the Responder. 
3. The Responder either accepts or rejects the offer.
4. If the Responder accepts, the Offeror and Responder get money according to the offer. 
5. If rejects, both get nothing.
For example, if the Offeror offers $20 and the Responder accepts, the Offeror gets $80 and the Responder gets $20. 
If the Responder rejects, both get no money
6. You are playing a series of game sets with another player. 
7. In one set, you play as an Offeror once and switch the role (two games in one set).
8. You will play many game sets with the same player. So, you will have a chance to guess the otherâ€™s strategy and evolve your own.

derive your own strategy to get as much money as possible.
