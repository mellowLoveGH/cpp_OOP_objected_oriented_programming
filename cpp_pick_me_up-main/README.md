Pick Me Up:
1. You are interviewing a number of applicants. For each applicant, you either pick him/her up or pass. 
2. If you once pass an applicant, you cannot hire him/her.
3. Definitely, you want to hire the best.

What will be your strategy?
1. You can meet up to NMEETS applicants, and each applicant has its own score.
2. You need to determine whether you pick him/her or not at the site of interview based on his/her score and scores of applicants you already met.
3. You cannot see the scores of applicant you will see in the future. 
4. If you do not pick him/her, you cannot pick him/her again.
